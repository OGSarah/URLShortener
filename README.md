# URL Shortener System Design
This repository contains a minimal URL shortener designed with a Node.js/Express backend, MongoDB for storage, and a SwiftUI iOS app for testing. The system is built to demonstrate a complete
end-to-end solution for URL shortening, focusing on clear use cases, requirements, and a simple yet extensible design.

# System Overview
The URL shortener system allows users to convert long URLs into short unique codes and redirect from these codes to the orginal URLs. It includes a RESTful backend API and an iOS app for user interaction, 
designed with scalability and simplicity in mind.

# Use Cases
- A user enters a URL and gets back a short URL.
- The short URL will direct to the orginal URL when it is accessed.
- The short URL will have a default lifespan and can be customized.
- The short URL tracks its usage through metrics and analytics, but this tracking does not have to be performed in real-time.

# Requirements
### Functional Requirements:
- Users can submit a valid long URL to receive a short URL.
- Short URLs redirect to the original long URL.
- iOS app provides a simple interface to shorten URLs and display results.
- System stores URL mappings persistently.
- Short codes are unique and collision-free.

### Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Handle basic API requests with low latency (< 1s for redirects).
- Scalability: Design supports future scaling (e.g., distributed database, load balancing).
- Reliability: Ensure short URLs remain valid indefinitely.
- Simplicity: Minimal implementation for local testing and development.
- Security: Validate input URLs to prevent malicious redirects.

# System Design
### Architecture:
- Backend: Node.js with Express for RESTful APIs.
   - Endpoints:
      - POST /shorten: Accepts a long URL and returns a short URL.
      - GET /:code: Redirects to the original URL based on the short code.
   - Short code generation: Uses shortid for random, unique codes (6â€“8 characters, base62-like).
- Database: MongoDB for storing URL mappings.
  - Schema: { shortCode: String, longUrl: String, createdAt: Date }.
  - Indexes on shortCode for fast lookups.
- iOS App: SwiftUI app for testing URL shortening and redirection.
  - Features: URL input, shorten button, short URL display, and tap-to-open functionality.
- Communication: HTTP/JSON for API requests, URLSession for iOS app communication.

### Design Decisions:
- Short Code Generation: Random shortid for simplicity; base62 with counter-based encoding can be added for scalability.
- Database Choice: MongoDB for flexibility and ease of setup (local or cloud-based with Atlas).
- iOS App: SwiftUI for modern, lightweight UI; minimal features for testing.
- Local Testing: Backend runs on localhost:3000, accessible by the iOS app in Xcode simulator.
- Extensibility: Modular design allows adding rate limiting later.

### Project Structure:
- server.js: Express backend with API logic.
- .env: Environment variables (MongoDB URI, base URL, port).
- URLShortenter/URLShortener/URLShortener.xcodeproj: SwiftUI iOS app for URL shortening and testing


# Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites:
- Node.js: v14 or higher.
- MongoDB: Local installation or MongoDB Atlas account.
- Xcode: Xcode 26 or higher for the iOS app.
- npm: For backend dependencies.
- Git: For cloning the repo.

### Backend Setup:
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd URLShortener
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```plain
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/urlshortener
   BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   PORT=3000
   ```
   - For MongoDB Atlas, replace `MONGO_URI` with your Atlas connection string.
4. Start MongoDB:
   - Local: Run `mongod`.
   - Atlas: Ensure your IP is allowlisted.
5. Start the backend.
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
### iOS App Setup:
1. Navigate to the iOS app directory:
   ```bash
   cd URLShortener/URLShortener
   ```
2. Open in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open URLShortener.xcodeproj
   ```
3. Ensure the backend is running and accessible.
4. Build and run in Xcode's simulator or on a device (not sure if this is possible when using local host).

# Usage
### API Endpoints
- Shorten URL (`POST /shorten`):
   - Request: `{ "longUrl": "https://example.com" }`
   - Response: `{ "shortUrl": "http://localhost:3000/abc123" }`
   - Example:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"longUrl":"https://example.com"}' http://localhost:3000/shorten
     ```
- Redirect (`GET /:code`):
  - Access: `http://localhost:3000/abc123`
  - Redirects to the original URL.
 
### iOS App
1. Open the app in the Xcode simulator.
2. Enter a valid URL (e.g., https://example.com).
3. Tap "Shorten URL" to get a short URL.
4. Tap the short URL to test redirection in a browser.
5. Errors (e.g., invalid URL) are displayed below the button.

# Testing
- Backend:
  - Test /shorten and /:code with Postman or curl.
  - Verify MongoDB stores mappings in the urls collection.
- iOS App:
  - Test in Xcode simulator.
  - Use `ngrok` to expose the local backend or deploy to a cloud service.
  - Confirm URL shortening and redirection work end-to-end.
- Edge Cases:
  - Test invalid URLs (should return 400).
  - Test non-existent short codes (should return 404).
